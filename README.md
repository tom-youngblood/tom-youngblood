ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m @tom-youngblood, a Master's student in Data Science at Denver University, and a recent graduate of Economics at USC.

ðŸŽ“ Educational Background: I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Economics from the University of Southern California and am currently advancing my expertise in data science through my master's studies at the University of Denver.

ðŸ‘€ Interests: My professional and academic journey is driven by a deep interest in data science, machine learning, and data engineering. Outside of these fields, I'm passionate about music, art, and innovation, constantly seeking ways to intertwine these interests with my technical work.

ðŸŒ± Current Learning Path: In my master's program, I am delving into advanced topics like deep learning algorithms, the mathematics underpinning data science, database management, and data visualization, among others. On top of this, I love to continue my education outside of my masters program; I'm currently reading Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems. I've recently discovered an interest in data engineering and love to apply concepts @ CoEfficient Labs, where I've been building an ETL pipeline and analysis of LinkedIn users who interact with our content.

ðŸŒ± Skills:
- Python: ScikitLearn, Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, SQLAlchemy.
- SQL: Relational Databases, Google BigQuery, MySQLServer.
- R: GGPlot2, Machine Learning Frameworks, Deep Learning Frameworks, Statistical Modeling.
